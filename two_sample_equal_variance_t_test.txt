TWO-SAMPLE T-TEST (EQUAL VARIANCES ASSUMED)

SCENARIO:

You're testing if two different thumbnails  used for the same show affect average user listening time.

- Group A: Users who saw Thumbnail Version A
- Group B: Users who saw Thumbnail Version B

You assume that the variability in listening time is similar for both groups.

2. DATA:

Thumbnail A group:
- n₁ = 100
- Mean listening time = 22.3 minutes
- SD = 6.5 minutes

Thumbnail B group:
- n₂ = 100
- Mean listening time = 20.1 minutes
- SD = 6.3 minutes

Significance level (α) = 0.05

3. HYPOTHESES:

H₀: μ₁ = μ₂       (No difference in average listening time)
H₁: μ₁ ≠ μ₂       (There is a difference)

4. FORMULA:

Pooled SD:

Sp = sqrt [ ((n₁-1)s₁² + (n₂-1)s₂²) / (n₁ + n₂ - 2) ]
   = sqrt [ (99)(42.25) + (99)(39.69) / 198 ] ≈ sqrt(40.97) ≈ 6.40

Standard Error:

SE = Sp * sqrt(1/n₁ + 1/n₂) = 6.40 * sqrt(1/100 + 1/100) ≈ 0.905

t = (22.3 - 20.1) / 0.905 ≈ 2.43

df = n1 + n2 -2  = 198 

DECISION:

Critical t (two-tailed, df = 198, α = 0.05) ≈ ±1.972

Since 2.43 > 1.972 → Reject H₀

p-value ≈ 0.016 < 0.05 → Reject H₀
