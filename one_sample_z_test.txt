Scenario:

A soda company claims that their 500 ml drink contains on average 35g of sugar.
You collect a sample and suspect the actual sugar content is higher than claimed.

Objective:
Test whether the true mean sugar content is greater than 35g using a one-sample z-test.

Data:
Population mean (μ₀ under H₀) = 35g
Sample size (n) = 100
Sample mean (x̄) = 36g
Population standard deviation (σ) = 2g
Significance level (α) = 0.05

Step 1: Define Hypotheses

Since you suspect it's more, this is a right-tailed test:
- Null Hypothesis (H₀): μ = 35g
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): μ > 35g

Step 2: Calculate the Test Statistic (z)

SE = σ / √n = 2 / √100 = 0.2
z = (x̄ - μ) / SE = (36 - 35) / 0.2 = 1 / 0.2 = 5.0

Step 3: Find the Critical Value

For α = 0.05 (right-tailed test):
Critical z-value = 1.645

Step 4: Decision Rule

Compare z = 5.0 to the critical value:
Since 5.0 > 1.645 → Reject H₀

Or use p-value:
p-value for z = 5.0 ≈ 0.0000003
Since p < 0.05 → Reject H₀

Step 5: Conclusion

There is strong statistical evidence that the true average sugar content is greater than 35g.
The soda company may be underreporting sugar in its product.
