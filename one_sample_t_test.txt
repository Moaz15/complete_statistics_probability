ONE-SAMPLE T-TEST

SCENARIO:

You are testing a new diet plan. The average weight loss from past diets was 0 kg.
You collect a sample of 15 participants using the new diet and observe their average weight loss.
You want to know: Is the new diet significantly different (better) in terms of weight loss?
Use a one-sample t-test (because the sample size is small and population standard deviation is unknown).

DATA:

Population mean under H₀ (μ₀) = 0 kg  
Sample size (n) = 15  
Sample mean (x̄) = 2.8 kg  
Sample standard deviation (s) = 2.5 kg  
Significance level (α) = 0.05

HYPOTHESES:

H₀: μ = 0  
H₁: μ > 0   (Right-tailed test — testing for improvement)

FORMULA:

t = (x̄ - μ₀) / (s / √n)
SE = s / √n = 2.5 / √15 ≈ 0.645
t = (2.8 - 0) / 0.645 ≈ 4.34

Degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 14

CRITICAL VALUE:

From t-table at α = 0.05 and df = 14:
Critical t ≈ 1.761

Decision Rule:
- If t > 1.761 → Reject H₀
Since 4.34 > 1.761 → Reject H₀

P-VALUE METHOD:

Using a t-distribution calculator:
p-value ≈ 0.0005

Since p < 0.05 → Reject H₀ 

CONCLUSION:

There is strong statistical evidence that the average weight loss using the new diet
is significantly greater than 0. The diet appears to be effective.


SUMMARY OF CONCEPTS:

- One-sample t-test is used when:
  • You are comparing one sample mean to a known value
  • Population standard deviation (σ) is unknown
  • Sample size is small (n < 30)

- It uses the t-distribution, not z-distribution
- Requires degrees of freedom: df = n - 1
- Decision can be made using either:
  • t vs. critical value
  • p-value vs. α
